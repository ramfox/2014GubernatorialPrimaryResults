# Transform contains instructions for creating repeatable, auditable scripts
# that qri can execute for you. Currently transforms are written in the skylark
# scripting language, which is modeled after the python programming language
# for more info check https://qri.io/docs/transforms
transform:
  scriptpath: tf.sky

# use viz to provide custom a HTML template of your dataset
# the currently accepted syntax is 'html'
# scriptpath is the path to your template, relative to this file:
# viz:
#   syntax: html
#   scriptpath: template.html

# the body of a dataset is data itself. either a path to a file on your computer,
# or a URL that leads to the raw data
